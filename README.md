# GeneralUtils

Public repo with a sanitized copy of my `~/.zshrc` (see `.zshrc.example`).

- Copy `.zshrc.example` to `~/.zshrc` if you want a starting point.
- Sensitive tokens have been replaced with placeholders like `<REDACTED:...>`.
- Shell helpers included: `grephelp`, `sedhelp`, `awkhelp`, `manh`, `cheat` (+ aliases).
